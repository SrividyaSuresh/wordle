# wordle
Wordle was fun, right. Such a simple game, unencumbered fun. So, a friend and I wrote the logic for it. But without the UI. So, basically lame print statements saying '4th block is green'. Lets just say it needs more work. Check it out!

## what you can do!?
Fork this repo and add an UI to this game.
